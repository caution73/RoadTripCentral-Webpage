RoadTripCentral (Website)<br>
This is a webpage that highlights video content featuring exciting automobiles and fantastic scenery. Sit back and enjoy the creative/entertaining content or use the built-in National Park Service interface to learn more about what the wild U.S. has to offer.

Motivation<br>
I have had a slightly unhealthy obsession with cars since a young age, and over the years that lead me to creating automotive video content that I've shared with the world via Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. I have always wanted to make a website for this venture (dubbed RoadTripCentral), and I've finally taken the time to make it happen!

Features<br>
The most significant features that I would like to point out in the website are the "carousels" that I used to display collections of videos and images (I just recently learned how to create them), as well as the integrated NPS information on the "Plan Your Trip" page.

Installation<br>
Visit the GitHub repository at https://github.com/caution73/mod1_story_project, where you can fork the code and/or download the code to your own computer.

Contribute<br>
If you would like to contribute to the development of this project, I would be thrilled to improve the styling throughout, as well as further develop the NPS page by creating additional search fields for users to obtain other useful information from the API.


Unresolved Problems<br>
The overall functionality is present, but I would love to make drastic improvements to functionality as well as styling. The main issues I am currently dealing with involve the information table that pops up once the user selects a NPS location in the NPS page. There are several fields that are difficult to populate due to the data structure of the API information. Some CSS issues that I'm working on resolving involve making sure that the page has an adequately responsive design (no overflowing content, create break points, etc.)

Stretch Goals<br>
Aspirational improvements for the page include:

Changing the background video (on Home page) to be sourced from the RoadTripCentral YouTube page.
Expanding the usability of the NPS interface to include additional search fields as well as more conveniently displayed information.
Adding addional images and videos from the RoadTripCentral social media profiles.
Refactoring the code to be more efficient and easy-to-read.
Developing the About page.
Creating an additional page to present RoadTripCentral video pricing options.
Creating comment sections or other ways for users to interact with RoadTripCentral/others.
Include login information and a "favorite" button for either videos or NPS locations that allows a user to save their favorite content.


Credits<br>
I'd like to thank all those that have helped me debug and test the website (special shout out to Arwa, Anthony, and Annson), as well as those that have taken the time to view the website. I hope that my content has provided you with a memorable experience...and if it hasn't yet, come back to try it later. It will only be improving!
